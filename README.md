# Multimodal-Hate-Speech-Detection-with-Fine-tuned-BERT-Language-model
Developed a multimodal hate speech detection system leveraging a fine-tuned BERT language model, achieving an accuracy of 87.05% on a balanced restaurant review dataset (1000 reviews, positive/negative). <br>
Researched and implemented a BERT-based approach for identifying hate speech in text data.<br>
Constructed a balanced multimodal dataset utilizing 1000 restaurant reviews <br>
Fine-tuned the BERT model to effectively classify hate speech and non-hate speech in text, achieving consistent performance across multiple test datasets (accuracy range: 85% - 88%).<br>
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as loss (0.4458), accuracy (0.8705), precision (0.8630), and recall (0.8873). <br>
Compared the BERT model's performance with other potential models for hate speech detection and identified BERT as the most effective approach for this specific task.<br>
